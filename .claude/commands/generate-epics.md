# üß© Epics Generator Prompt

You are a world-class requirements analyst and software architect. Your task is to analyze the product documentation and wireframes for the MVP and generate a **comprehensive and structured list of epics**.

This prompt **does not produce user stories**. Instead, it defines the top-level building blocks (epics) that will later be broken down.

---

## üéØ Objective

Generate a list of epics based on the requirements document and available wireframes. Do not create user stories.

For each epic, include:

- A brief **description**
- Its **key features or capabilities**
- The related **wireframes** (if available)
- **Priority** (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
- The relevant **user type** (e.g., Consumer, Admin, Business Owner)
- An **argument why this is an epic** and not just a story or task
- Any known **dependencies** with other epics
- Any known **risks, blockers, or ambiguity areas**
- üõ†Ô∏è Required **Tooling / SDKs / APIs** (optional, if applicable)

---

## üìÅ Inputs

You have full access to all relevant documentation. You **must** analyze and visually inspect the following:

- üìÑ The product requirements document(s)
- üñº All wireframes (must be interpreted visually)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Technical documentation available under the `technical/` directory

> Wireframes and product documents must be deeply analyzed ‚Äî both textual and visual information are essential. This is a mandatory step.

---

## üßµ Additional Guidelines

- Epics may span multiple screens or wireframes.
- Grouping can be screen-based or logical (cross-cutting); use your judgment.
- Do not mix client platforms. If functionality appears in both mobile and web, split into two epics.
- Always use **Sequential Thinking (MCP)**, including the Context7 variant, to ensure decomposition and grouping is disciplined, layered, and avoids hallucination.
- If there are edge cases not covered in docs but logically necessary, flag them in ‚ö†Ô∏è.
- You are expected to identify and include critical setup or production-readiness epics if applicable to the type of product (e.g., initial infrastructure, CI/CD setup, release readiness).

## üìä Output Format

```markdown
# üì¶ Epic: [Epic Title]
**ID**: `EPIC-KEY`

## üß† Why This Is an Epic
Explain why this group of functionality deserves to be treated as an epic rather than separate stories.

## üìÑ Description
High-level explanation of what this epic includes and what value it delivers.

## üß∞ Key Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## üñº Wireframes Referenced
- `/wireframes/screen-name.png`
- (none if no wireframes exist)

## üë§ User Type(s)
- Event Organizer / Attendee / Admin / System

## üíª Target Platform
- mobile
- web-panel
- backend-only

## üèÅ Priority
High / Medium / Low

## üîó Dependencies
- Depends on EPIC-EVENTS
- Unblocks EPIC-FEEDBACK
- (none)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks / Blockers / Ambiguities
- Missing business rules on ticket expiration
- Wireframe doesn‚Äôt match requirements for X
- Integration behavior unclear with calendar provider

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tooling / SDKs / APIs
- Google Calendar API
- Stripe SDK
- (optional section ‚Äì include only if clearly relevant)
```

> _The following examples use generic epics from an unrelated domain (event management platform) for illustration only._

## üìà Visual Dependencies & Roadmap

### 1. Phased Grouping (Labeled by Batch)

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Phase 1 - Access Setup
    EPIC-LOGIN["LOGIN<br/>User Authentication"]
    EPIC-PROFILE["PROFILE<br/>Account Management"]
  end

  subgraph Phase 2 - Core Functionality
    EPIC-EVENTS["EVENTS<br/>Browse & Create Events"]
    EPIC-TICKETS["TICKETS<br/>Buy & Manage Tickets"]
  end

  subgraph Phase 3 - Communication & Feedback
    EPIC-FEEDBACK["FEEDBACK<br/>Ratings & Comments"]
    EPIC-NOTIFY["NOTIFY<br/>Email & Push Alerts"]
  end

  subgraph Phase 4 - Analytics & Settings
    EPIC-ANALYTICS["ANALYTICS<br/>Usage Reports"]
    EPIC-CONFIG["CONFIG<br/>Platform Settings"]
  end

  EPIC-LOGIN --> EPIC-PROFILE
  EPIC-PROFILE --> EPIC-EVENTS
  EPIC-EVENTS --> EPIC-TICKETS
  EPIC-TICKETS --> EPIC-FEEDBACK
  EPIC-PROFILE --> EPIC-NOTIFY
```

### 2. Critical Path

- EPIC-LOGIN ‚Üí EPIC-PROFILE ‚Üí EPIC-EVENTS ‚Üí EPIC-TICKETS

### 3. Workable in Parallel

- EPIC-NOTIFY
- EPIC-ANALYTICS
- EPIC-CONFIG

## üßµ Additional Guidelines

- Use **Sequential Thinking (MCP)** and **Context7** when defining and organizing epics.
- Epics may span multiple screens or wireframes.
- Grouping can be screen-based or logical (cross-cutting); use your judgment.
- Always include **setup epics** (e.g., environment/infrastructure) and **deployment epics** if applicable to the delivery model (e.g., mobile store vs web launch).
- If there are edge cases not covered in docs but logically necessary, flag them in ‚ö†Ô∏è.

---

## ‚úÖ Goal

The resulting epics list will be used for:
- Story generation using a separate prompt
- Effort estimation and team planning
- Building a release roadmap with phases and parallelization

Be precise. Be grounded. Do not hallucinate.

---

## üìù Output

- Generate a single **Markdown (.md)** file containing the full list of epics.
- Each epic must follow the defined structure and include all specified fields.
- The file should be named following this convention:  
  `epics-[project-name]-[phase].md`  
  Example: `epics-conference-app-mvp.md`

- If applicable, group epics by theme or module using level-2 headers (`##`).
- Maintain clarity and consistent formatting to support downstream use in:
  - Story generation
  - Technical estimation
  - Planning and roadmap reviews

- Do **not** include user stories. This file is strictly for epic-level analysis.
