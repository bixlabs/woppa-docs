## üß™ Post-analysis: Story Set Review

After analyzing all stories systematically, the story set shows excellent cohesion with simplified, clear sequential flow:

**Flow Analysis:**
- REDEEM-MOB-001 ‚Üí REDEEM-MOB-002 ‚Üí (REDEEM-MOB-003 if auth needed OR REDEEM-MOB-004 if authenticated) ‚Üí (REDEEM-MOB-005 if cancellation OR REDEEM-MOB-006 if payment processing) ‚Üí REDEEM-MOB-007
- Stories represent a complete user journey from offer viewing to code usage
- Clear decision points (authentication, payment cancellation vs processing)

**Consistency Check:**
- All stories reference the same offer redemption context
- Authentication handling is consistently treated as external dependency
- Payment processing consolidated into unified approach in REDEEM-MOB-006
- Error handling patterns differentiate between cancellation (REDEEM-MOB-005) and other failures (REDEEM-MOB-006)

**Story Boundaries:**
- Each story has distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
- Dependencies are clearly identified and external to the epic
- Success/failure paths are appropriately separated by type
- Navigation endpoints connect properly to other epics

**Architecture Improvements Made:**
- Eliminated RED-004 and RED-005 by consolidating payment verification into REDEEM-MOB-006
- Simplified payment flow by handling verification within offer code display
- Reduced complexity while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- Clearer separation of concerns between cancellation and other payment failures

The simplified story set provides more efficient implementation while maintaining complete functional coverage.
