### 🔹 `AUTH-MOB-001` – Email and Password Registration

**Summary**:  
Users can create a new account using email, password, and basic personal information.

**Justification**:  
Provides traditional registration method for users who prefer not to use Google OAuth.

**User Story**:  
"As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and password, so that I can access personalized features and redeem offers."

**🎯 Objective**:  
Users can successfully create accounts with email/password and receive verification emails.

**⛓ Dependencies**:  
Email service provider, backend user creation API, password validation system.

**✅ Acceptance Criteria**:
- Registration form displays fields for: email, password, first name, last name
- Email field validates proper email format in real-time
- Password field enforces requirements: minimum 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character
- Password field includes show/hide toggle functionality
- Form validates all required fields before enabling submission
- Successful registration sends verification email to user
- Clear error messages for validation failures and duplicate emails
- Form validates email is not already registered with Google OAuth
- Clear error message for Google-registered emails: "Este email ya está registrado con Google. Usa 'Ingresar con Google'."
- Terms and conditions checkbox is required before submission

**🧰 Technical Tasks**:
- Create registration form component with all required fields
- Implement real-time email format validation
- Add password visibility toggle functionality
- Create backend API endpoint for user registration (or use Firebase Auth)
- Integrate email service for verification emails (or use Firebase Auth)
- Implement duplicate email detection and error handling
- Implement cross-authentication email conflict detection
- Add backend API for checking existing registration methods by email
- Create consistent error messaging for authentication conflicts
- Add terms and conditions acceptance flow
- Create client-side form validation logic

**⚙️ External Setup / Config Required**
- Email service provider configuration (SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar)
- LGPD compliance review for data collection
- Terms and conditions document creation
- Email template design for verification emails

**❗ Pending Confirmations**
- Specific password complexity requirements (current: 8 chars, 1 upper, 1 number, 1 special)
- Whether email verification is required before account activation
- Error message wording for various validation failures

**📝 Notes & Observations**
- Wireframe doesn't show first name/last name fields - needs clarification against business decision
- Form should match simplified registration requirements (no phone number)


**🖼 Wireframe Reference**
- Exists: Partial
- Filename: `woppa-wireframe-4-register.png`
- Note: Shows email/password fields but missing name fields mentioned in business decisions

**📊 PERT Estimation**:
- **Optimistic**: 10hours
- **Realistic**: 13 hours
  - Comments: Assumes that AI tools will accelerate development, that the UI is simple, that the project scaffolding is complete (toasts). That register happens after entering name and last in a separate pre register onboarding.  That we use firebase for user registration.
    - Frontend UI: ~4h (register + names)
    - Frontend Logic: ~4h (includes auth store and showing login vs AppStack depending on the user)
    - Integration: ~ 1.5h
    - Backend: ~2h (firebase do the core, and we sync the user in our db)
    - Manual Testing: ~1.5h
- **Pessimistic**: 16 hours
- **Final PERT Estimate: 13 hours**

### 🔹 `AUTH-MOB-002` – Google OAuth Registration

**Summary**:  
Users can create accounts using their Google credentials for faster onboarding.

**Justification**:  
Reduces friction in registration process and leverages existing user credentials.

**User Story**:  
"As a new user, I want to register using my Google account, so that I can quickly create an account without typing personal information."

**🎯 Objective**:  
Seamless Google OAuth integration that creates user accounts with Google profile data.

**⛓ Dependencies**:  
Firebase Auth configuration, Expo Firebase integration, Google Sign-In provider setup.

**✅ Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Registro con Google" button is prominently displayed on registration screen
- Clicking Google button opens native Google OAuth flow via Firebase Auth
- Successful OAuth returns user to app with account created or authenticated
- User profile is populated with Google data: name, email, profile picture (if available)
- If Google account already exists in system, authenticate user automatically (expected behavior)
- OAuth flow validates email is not already registered with email/password method
- Clear error message for email/password conflicts: "Este email ya está registrado con contraseña. Inicia sesión con email y contraseña."
- User is redirected to login tab after email/password conflict error
- Error handling for OAuth cancellation or failures
- Firebase Auth handles user record creation and Google account linking

**🧰 Technical Tasks**:
- Integrate Firebase Auth with Google Sign-In provider in Expo
- Configure Google Sign-In using Expo's AuthSession or Firebase SDK
- Set up Firebase Auth Google provider configuration
- Implement email/password conflict detection (not Google account duplicates)
- Handle existing Google account authentication automatically
- Create error messaging for email/password auth conflicts only

- Google Sign-In provider configuration in Firebase Console
- Expo app.json configuration for Google Sign-In
- Firebase config files integration with Expo (using expo install firebase)
- Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 client credentials (if needed beyond Firebase)

**❗ Pending Confirmations**
- Handling of edge cases where Google profile lacks required information
- Expo-specific configuration details for Firebase Auth Google Sign-In
- **Apple Store Requirement**: Sign in with Apple must be implemented alongside Google Sign-In per App Store Review Guidelines 4.8

**📝 Notes & Observations**
- Using Expo + Firebase Auth for Google Sign-In integration simplifies configuration and token management
- Existing Google accounts should authenticate automatically, not show as duplicates
- Only email/password registrations conflict with Google registration attempts for same email
- Expo provides built-in support for Firebase Auth through expo-firebase-auth or direct Firebase SDK
- **Apple Store Compliance**: Per App Store Review Guidelines 4.8, apps using third-party login (Google) must also offer Sign in with Apple as equivalent option

## 🧪 Post-analysis: Story Set Review

After analyzing all stories, I've identified the following optimizations and observations:

**Overlaps and Dependencies:**
- AUTH-MOB-001 and AUTH-MOB-002 share backend user creation logic and can reuse validation components
- AUTH-MOB-003 reuses OAuth setup from AUTH-MOB-002 for Google login
- AUTH-MOB-006 (session management) is a dependency for all other authentication stories

**Consistency Improvements:**
- All stories maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Session management approach is unified across registration, login, and logout flows
- OAuth implementation is shared between registration and login stories

**Scope Clarifications:**
- Email verification (AUTH-MOB-004) may be optional for MVP based on requirements analysis
- Password reset flow (AUTH-MOB-005) could use Firebase Auth default implementation to reduce scope

**No conflicts or duplications were identified.** Stories are properly scoped and complementary.

---

## 📌 Stories with High Risk or Pending Decisions

- **AUTH-MOB-001**: Missing wireframe details for name fields, uncertain email verification requirements
- **AUTH-MOB-002**: Uncertainty around Firebase Auth vs direct OAuth implementation 
- **AUTH-MOB-004**: No wireframe, unclear if email verification required for MVP
- **AUTH-MOB-005**: No wireframes, Firebase Auth vs custom implementation pending
- **AUTH-MOB-006**: Session timeout policy undefined, logout UI location unclear
