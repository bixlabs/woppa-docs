## Epic: Authentication

### Screen: Login

### Screen: Register  
**Wireframe:** `woppa-wireframe-4-register.png`  
**Description:**  
Enables account creation using email and password or Google. After email and password registration, a verification email is sent to confirm the user's address.

### Screen: Email Verification  
**Wireframe:** _Not defined_  
**Description:**  
Screen shown after the user clicks the verification link in their email. If using Firebase Auth, email confirmation can be completed via web link without entering a code. However, we may still display a confirmation screen to inform the user and trigger a backend check to verify their status.

> In the early stages of the project, email verification may be skipped. Since all offers must be paid through Mercado Pago, and this process requires a real user and valid payment method, it helps prevent abuse even without email validation.


### Screen: Password Reset Request

**Description:**  
Allows users to request a password reset by entering their email.

### Screen: Password Reset Confirmation  
**Wireframe:** _Not defined_

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If using Firebase Auth with default reset flow, this screen may not be needed. The user can be redirected to a Firebase-hosted page to complete the password reset without a custom UI.
