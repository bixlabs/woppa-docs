This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This repository is for **requirements analysis, epic definition, and work estimation** for the Woppa MVP project. The main objective is to transform the technical requirements into actionable epics with user stories, acceptance criteria, and hour-based estimates including uncertainty analysis.

## Project Context

**Woppa** is a mobile app and web platform MVP connecting consumers with businesses through 2x1 promotions and simple discounts in Brazil. The project focuses on business model validation rather than scalability.

### Current Phase
- Requirements gathering and analysis
- Epic definition and story breakdown  
- Work estimation with uncertainty assessment

- `source-specs/*.png`: Wireframes for key user flows (current UI reference)
